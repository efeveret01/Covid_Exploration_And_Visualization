# Covid_Exploration_And_Visualization

## The exploration and visualization of Covid-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI

Using Microsoft SQL Server the Covid-19 data downloaded from the **'Our World in Data'**
webpage[1] is cleaned, imported and explored. See the CovidDataExploration for the exploration stage.

After exploration, information that was seen as 'interesting to know' about the Covid-19
situation was made into SQL views that were imported and visualized by Microsoft Power BI.
See the *CovidDataViews* for the selected data that was imported to the Power BI, and finally
look at the *Covid_BI_Project* for the final dashboard.
