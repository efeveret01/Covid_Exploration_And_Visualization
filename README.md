# Covid_Exploration_And_Visualization
## Overview

This project explores and visualizes COVID-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI.

The dataset is sourced from Our World in Data and processed in several stages:

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration (SQL):**
The COVID-19 dataset is downloaded, cleaned, and explored using Microsoft SQL Server.
See the CovidDataExploration SQL script for the exploration stage.

2. **View Creation (SQL):**
Based on the exploration phase, data points identified as "interesting to know" are organized into SQL views.
See CovidDataViews for the SQL views that were created.

3. **Visualization (Power BI):**
The SQL views are imported into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.
See covid_dashboard.pbix for the final dashboard.

## How to Run

1. Download covid_dashboard.pbix from the repository file list.

2. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
(Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.)
