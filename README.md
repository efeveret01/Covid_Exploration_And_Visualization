# Covid_Exploration_And_Visualization

## The exploration and visualization of Covid-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI

Using Microsoft SQL Server the Covid-19 data downloaded from the **'Our World in Data'**
webpage[1] is cleaned, imported and explored. See the CovidDataExploration for the exploration stage.

After exploration, information that was seen as 'interesting to know' about the Covid-19
situation was made into SQL views that were imported and visualized by Microsoft Power BI.
See the *CovidDataViews* for the selected data that was imported to the Power BI, and finally
look at the *Covid_BI_Project* for the final dashboard.

# Covid_Exploration_And_Visualization
## Overview

This project explores and visualizes COVID-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI.

The dataset is sourced from Our World in Data and processed in several stages:

1. Data Cleaning & Exploration (SQL)
The COVID-19 dataset is downloaded, cleaned, and explored using Microsoft SQL Server.
See the CovidDataExploration SQL script for the exploration stage.

2. View Creation (SQL)
Based on the exploration phase, data points identified as "interesting to know" are organized into SQL views.
See CovidDataViews for the SQL views that were created.

3. Visualization (Power BI)
The SQL views are imported into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.
See Covid_BI_Project.pbix for the final dashboard.

## How to Run

1. Download Covid_BI_Project.pbix from the repository file list.

2. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
(Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.)
